So I wanted to try using Git pages, org-mode, and jekyll to try and run a technical blog as well as better put together resources for the classes I teach. It's quite possible I'll give up on this quickly and instead just stick with my wordpress.

I partly wanted to use this as an opportunity to play around more with formatting than what running a free wordpress instance general allows. Also, I kinda like the idea of having a local copy of the whole blog that I can work from and then push to publish. That might be because I'm a total dorkfish, though.
