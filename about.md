I'm a programming and computer science educator based in Portland, OR. I currently work for [Pixel Arts Game Education](http://gameeducationpdx.com).

In a former career, my academic interests and research was in:

+ higher-dimensional type theories
+ mathematical logic
+ proof assistants
+ and making all of the above more accessible outside academia
